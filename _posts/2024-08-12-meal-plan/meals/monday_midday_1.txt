Cucumber Salad

To make a flavorful cucumber salad, combine 3 cups of mixed greens like Romaine and arugula 
with 1 large cucumber thinly sliced, 1 cup of halved cherry tomatoes, 
and 1/4 cup of thinly sliced red onion or shallot. Add 1/4 cup of crumbled feta or goat cheese 
for creaminess and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of fresh chopped herbs like parsley, 
dill, or mint for brightness. For the dressing, whisk together 3 tablespoons of olive oil, 
1 tablespoon of lemon juice, 1 teaspoon of Dijon mustard, 1 teaspoon of honey, 
1 clove of minced garlic, and a pinch of salt and pepper. 
Toss the vegetables with the dressing just before serving, and garnish with toasted nuts or seeds, 
such as almonds or sunflower seeds, for added crunch and texture. 
This vibrant salad pairs perfectly with any meal or works as a light, refreshing standalone dish.
