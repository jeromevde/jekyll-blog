Smoked Salmon on Whole Grain Toast 

start by toasting two slices of whole grain bread until golden brown. In a small bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of cream cheese (or Greek yogurt for a lighter option) with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, salt, and pepper to taste. Spread this lemon-flavored cream cheese generously on each slice of toast. Next, layer 4 oz (about 113g) of smoked salmon over the cream cheese, folding the slices for a nice presentation if desired. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of rinsed and drained capers and 1 tablespoon of chopped fresh dill on top, adding delightful briny flavor. For extra freshness, consider garnishing with thin slices of cucumber, red onion, or a handful of arugula. Finish with a squeeze of lemon juice for brightness, and serve immediately for a nutritious breakfast or light lunch thatâ€™s packed with protein and flavor
