Quinoa and Black Bean Salad

Start by rinsing 1 cup of quinoa well under cold water to remove its natural coating, 
saponin, which can make it taste bitter. Cook the quinoa in 2 cups of vegetable broth 
or water until it's tender and the liquid is absorbed, about 15-20 minutes. 
Let it cool.Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mix together one drained and rinsed can of black beans (about 400g),
1 diced red bell pepper, 1 diced cucumber, 1 small red onion finely chopped, 
and a cup of cherry tomatoes halved.For the dressing, whisk together 3 tablespoons of olive oil, 
juice of 1 lime, 1 teaspoon of cumin, a pinch of cayenne pepper for some kick, salt, 
and pepper to taste.Once the quinoa has cooled, combine it with the vegetables, then pour over the dressing and mix well. 
Add in a generous amount of chopped fresh cilantro or parsley for freshness.For an extra nutritional boost,
 you can toss in some diced avocado just before serving, but be sure to do this last to prevent browning.
 This salad not only packs a punch in flavor with its mix of spices and fresh ingredients but is also incredibly nutritious, 
 offering a good balance of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. It's perfect for meal prep or a quick, healthy lunch.
