Asparagus Almond Beet Salad
Start by trimming and cleaning 500 grams of beets, 
then boil them until they can be easily pierced with a fork. 
Drain and while still warm, the skin will rub off easily under water. 
Set aside the skinless beets. Blanch 300 grams of asparagus by setting aside a bowl of ice water, 
boiling the asparagus for about 4 minutes or until firm but not crisp, 
then immediately cooling it in the ice bath. Chop the beets and asparagus into small bite-sized pieces. 
Prepare a dressing using 1 large shallot, 3 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar, 
3 tablespoons of Dijon mustard, and 1 tablespoon of mustard seeds. 
Toss the chopped beets, asparagus, and 1 cup of arugula with the cooled shallots mixture and dressing. 
Lightly toss again and top the salad with 21 grams of slivered almonds.
