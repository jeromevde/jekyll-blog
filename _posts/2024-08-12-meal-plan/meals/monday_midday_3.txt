Spaghetti Vongole

Start by cleaning 1kg of fresh clams under cold water, 
discarding any that don't close when tapped, 
and optionally soak them in salted water to purge sand.
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for 400g of spaghetti, 
cooking it until just shy of al dente. In a large pan,
heat 4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil over medium heat, 
then add 4 finely sliced garlic cloves and a small chopped fresh chili 
if you like some heat, cooking until the garlic is golden. 
Add the clams to the pan, pour in 100ml of dry white wine, cover, 
and let the clams steam until they open, about 3-5 minutes, 
discarding those that don't. Drain the spaghetti, reserving some pasta water. 
Toss the spaghetti with the clams in the pan, adding a bit of the pasta water if needed to create a sauce. 
Stir in most of a large handful of chopped fresh parsley, adjust for salt, 
and serve immediately with extra parsley on top and lemon wedges on the side if desired. 
Enjoy with a glass of white wine for a truly Italian experience.
