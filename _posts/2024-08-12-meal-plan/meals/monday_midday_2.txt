Ham & cheese Sandwich

To make an elevated ham and cheese sandwich with homemade sourdough bread, 
start by preparing the bread. Combine 1/4 cup of active sourdough starter with 1 1/4 cups 
lukewarm water, 3 cups of flour, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt, mixing until no dry spots remain. 
Let the dough ferment overnight (8-12 hours), shape it into a round, and allow it to rise for 
1-2 hours. Bake the dough in a preheated 450°F (230°C) oven using a Dutch oven: cover and bake 
for 20 minutes, then uncover and bake for 25-30 minutes more until golden brown. 

Once the bread is cool, slice two pieces for the sandwich. Lightly toast the slices for texture, 
then spread mustard, mayonnaise, or aioli on one or both. Layer crisp lettuce, 
2-3 slices of high-quality cooked ham, and 2 slices of cheese (such as Swiss, cheddar, or Gruyère).
Optionally, add tomato slices, pickles, or caramelized onions for extra flavor. 
For a warm sandwich, grill it in a panini press or skillet with a bit of butter until 
the bread is golden and the cheese melts. Serve the sandwich sliced in half alongside a side salad, 
chips, or soup for a complete and satisfying meal.
