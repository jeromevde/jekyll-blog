Lentil and Sweet Potato Soup -

Start by heating 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. 
Add 1 chopped onion, 2 minced garlic cloves, and cook until the onion is translucent. 
Add 2 diced carrots, 1 diced sweet potato, and saut√© for another 5 minutes. 
Stir in 1 cup of rinsed green or brown lentils, then pour in 4 cups of vegetable broth or water. 
Season with 1 teaspoon of cumin, 1/2 teaspoon of smoked paprika, salt, and pepper. 
Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer, covering the pot. 
Cook for about 30 minutes or until the lentils and sweet potatoes are tender. 
For a creamier texture, you can blend part of the soup or leave it chunky as preferred. 
Finish by stirring in a handful of spinach or kale until wilted, and adjust seasoning. 
Serve hot, garnished with fresh parsley or a dollop of yogurt if you like. 
This soup is perfect for a nourishing midday meal.
