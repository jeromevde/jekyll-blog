Braised Red Cabbage with Halloumi and Lentils

Start by finely shredding 1 medium head of red cabbage and slicing 1 medium onion. 
In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil or butter over medium heat, 
then saut√© the sliced onion for about 5 minutes until softened. 
Add the shredded cabbage and 1 diced tart apple, cooking for another 5-7 minutes until 
the cabbage starts to wilt. Stir in 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar, 
1/4 cup of brown sugar (or honey/maple syrup), and 1 cup of vegetable or chicken broth, 
along with 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves, 
and salt and pepper to taste. If desired, add 1/4 cup of raisins or currants for added sweetness.
Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer, cover, and cook on low for about 45 minutes until the cabbage 
is tender. While the cabbage is cooking, prepare 1 cup of lentils according to package instructions.
 In a separate pan, slice 200g of halloumi cheese and grill or pan-fry until golden brown on both 
 sides. Once the cabbage is ready, fold in the cooked lentils, and serve topped with the crispy 
 halloumi. This dish makes a hearty and nutritious meal, perfect for any occasion
