Tzatziki

To make tzatziki bread in a pan, begin by mixing 3 cups of all-purpose or bread flour, 
2 1/4 teaspoons of instant yeast, and 1 teaspoon of salt in a large bowl. 
In a separate bowl, combine 1 cup of lukewarm water, 1/4 cup of plain Greek yogurt, 
1/4 cup of finely grated cucumber (squeezed to remove excess water), 
1 clove of minced garlic, 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh dill, 
and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, 
stirring until a sticky dough forms. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for 
about 5 minutes until smooth.

Next, place the dough in a greased pan (such as a 9x9-inch or similar-sized skillet), 
flattening it gently to fit the shape of the pan. Cover it with a clean kitchen towel and l
et it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size. 
Once risen, preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

Bake the dough in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes until it is golden 
brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. Allow the bread to cool slightly 
in the pan before slicing.

For the tzatziki sauce, mix 1 cup of plain Greek yogurt, 
1/2 cup of finely grated cucumber (squeezed to remove excess water), 
1-2 minced garlic cloves, 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, 
2 tablespoons of chopped fresh dill, and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl. 
Chill the tzatziki sauce in the fridge for at least 30 minutes to let the flavors meld.

To serve, slice the warm tzatziki bread and enjoy it with a generous dollop of tzatziki sauce.
 This pan-baked tzatziki bread is perfect as a side for grilled meats, roasted vegetables, 
 or as a base for open-faced Mediterranean sandwiches topped with fresh ingredients.
