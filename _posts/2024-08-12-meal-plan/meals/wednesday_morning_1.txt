Berry Banana Smoothie Bowl
Blend 1 ripe banana, 1 cup of mixed berries (fresh or frozen), and 1/2 cup of Greek yogurt 
until smooth. Pour the mixture into a bowl and top it with sliced fresh fruit like strawberries
 and kiwi, a sprinkle of granola for crunch, and a handful of chia seeds for added fiber 
 and omega-3s. You can also drizzle a bit of honey or maple syrup on top for extra sweetness 
 if desired. This vibrant smoothie bowl is not only visually appealing but also packed with
  antioxidants, protein, and healthy carbs to kickstart your day and keep you satisfied until 
  your next meal!
