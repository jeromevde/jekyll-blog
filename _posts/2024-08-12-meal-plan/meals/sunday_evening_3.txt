Stuffed Sweet Potato
Begin with 300 grams of cooked sweet potato. 
Roast or microwave until soft, then slice in half. 
Cook 45 grams of chickpeas and prepare 12 grape tomatoes, half an avocado, 4 radishes, 
Â¼ cup of cilantro, 1 large jalapeno pepper, juice from 2 limes, and 1 lemon, 
and 1 teaspoon of chili powder. Once the sweet potato is cooked,
 scoop out some of the flesh to make room for the filling. 
 Mash the avocado with lime juice, season with chili powder, 
 then spread this mixture inside the sweet potato. 
 Add the chickpeas, sliced tomatoes, radishes, jalapeno, and cilantro on top. 
 Squeeze additional lime and lemon over the potato for extra flavor.
