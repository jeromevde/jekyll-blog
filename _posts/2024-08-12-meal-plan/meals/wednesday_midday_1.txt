Mediterranean Quinoa Salad 
Cook 1 cup of quinoa and let it cool slightly, then mix it with a cup of diced cucumbers, 
halved cherry tomatoes, a handful of chopped parsley, and 1/4 cup of crumbled feta cheese. 
Drizzle with a dressing made from olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper to taste. 
For added protein, toss in a can of drained and rinsed chickpeas. 
This vibrant salad is not only nutritious, packed with fiber and healthy fats, 
but it also provides a refreshing burst of flavor that will keep you energized for the rest 
of the day. Enjoy it chilled or at room temperature for the ultimate convenience!
