Runner's Smoothie

In a blender, combine 1 medium cooked red beet (rich in nitrates, 
which can enhance blood flow and improve endurance), 
1 banana (providing natural sugars for quick energy and potassium to help prevent cramps), 
1 cup of spinach (packed with iron and antioxidants), and 1 tablespoon of chia seeds 
(loaded with omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, and protein). Add 1/2 teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda, 
which can help buffer lactic acid buildup during intense exercise, 
potentially improving performance and recovery. Blend these ingredients until smooth, 
and adjust the consistency with water or plant-based milk if needed. 
This smoothie not only provides essential vitamins and minerals to support your performance 
but also tastes great and helps keep you energized and hydrated throughout your runs.
