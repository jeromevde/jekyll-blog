Vegetable soup

To make a delicious vegetable soup, start by heating 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large pot 
over medium heat. Saut√© a diced onion, three minced garlic cloves, and 1 cup each of diced carrots 
and celery until softened, about 5 minutes. Add 1 cup each of diced zucchini, potatoes (or sweet 
potatoes), and green beans, then stir in 1-2 bay leaves, 1 teaspoon of dried thyme or 
Italian seasoning, and 1/4 teaspoon of red chili flakes for a hint of spice. Pour in 6 cups 
of chicken or vegetable broth, bring to a boil, and reduce the heat to simmer. 
If using, add 1 cup of shredded cooked chicken, cover, and let cook for 20-25 minutes 
until the vegetables are tender. Stir in 1 cup of diced tomatoes and 1/2 cup of frozen peas or corn,
 cooking for another 5 minutes. Adjust the salt and pepper to taste, then remove the bay leaves. 
 Serve the soup hot, garnished with fresh parsley, a drizzle of olive oil, 
 and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese for extra flavor. 
 This hearty and flavorful soup is perfect as a comforting meal!
