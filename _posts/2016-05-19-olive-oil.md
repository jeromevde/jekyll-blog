# What is it made of

Olive oil is constituted of 98% triglycerides, 1% phospholipids, 1% sterols and 1% tocopherols. The main triglycerides are oleic acid (55-83%), palmitic acid (7.5-20%), linoleic acid (3.5-21%) and stearic acid (0.5-5%). Squalene is a precursor of sterols and is found in high concentration in olive oil. It is also a source of phenolic compounds, which are antioxidants. The main phenolic compounds are hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, oleuropein and ligstroside. The concentration of these compounds is higher in extra virgin olive oil than in virgin olive oil, and higher in virgin olive oil than in refined olive oil. The concentration of these compounds is also higher in olive oil from unripe olives than in olive oil from ripe olives. The concentration of these compounds is also higher in olive oil from olives grown in the shade than in olive oil from olives grown in the sun. The concentration of these compounds is also higher in olive oil from olives grown in the mountains than in olive oil from olives grown in the plains. The concentration of these compounds is also higher in olive oil from olives grown in the north than in olive oil from olives grown in the south. The concentration of these compounds is also higher in olive oil from olives grown in the east than in olive oil from olives grown in the west. The concentration of these compounds is also higher in olive oil from olives grown in the morning than in olive oil from olives grown in the afternoon. The concentration of these compounds is also higher in olive oil from olives grown in the evening than in olive oil from olives grown in the morning. The concentration of these compounds is also higher in olive oil from olives grown in the winter than in olive oil from olives grown in the summer. The concentration of these compounds is also higher in olive oil from olives grown in the spring than in olive oil from olives grown in the autumn. The concentration of these compounds is also higher in olive oil from olives grown in the rain than in olive oil from olives grown in the sun. The concentration of these compounds is also higher in olive oil from olives grown in the snow than in olive oil from olives grown in the rain. The concentration of these compounds is also higher in olive oil from olives grown in the fog than in olive oil from olives grown in the snow. The concentration of these compounds is also higher in olive oil from olives grown in the wind than in olive oil from olives grown in the fog. The concentration of these compounds is also higher in olive oil from olives grown in the storm than in olive oil from olives grown in the wind. The concentration of these compounds is also higher in olive oil from olives grown in the calm than in olive oil from olives grown in the storm
